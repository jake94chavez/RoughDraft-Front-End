# Project-3 MERN Stack App
***
## Proposal
### The App
With this project I want to create a one-for-one peer-to-peer critiquing environment for aspiring authors to share their work in a place where they can get constructive feedback. The idea is to create a system that encourages thoughtful, constructive critiques of writing projects based on a system where writers earn credits for providing meaningful responses. When a writer contributes their opinions on the work of others, they will receive credits, which allow them to unlock the comments on their own work. This will encourage people to not only share their work so they can receive meaningful criticisms, but provide similarly purposeful feedback on the work of other users. The credit system is designed to limit the amount of inflammatory comments while simultaneously bolstering a culture where helpful remarks about the content of the work are promoted.
